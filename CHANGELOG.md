# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **SQLite Database Integration**: Migrated data storage from `localStorage` to a local SQLite database (`pti.db`) for improved reliability and persistence.
- **Express Backend Server**: Implemented a Node.js Express server (`server.mjs`) to handle data operations via a RESTful API.
- **REST API Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/pti`: Fetch all PTI records.
    - `POST /api/pti`: Add new PTI records.
    - `PUT /api/pti/:id`: Update existing records.
    - `POST /api/trash/move`: Move records to trash.
    - `POST /api/trash/restore`: Restore records from trash.
    - `GET/POST /api/settings/:key`: Manage application settings (e.g., email templates).
- **Requirements Documentation**: Added `docs/요구사항정의서.md` detailing functional and technical specifications.
- **Database Viewer Guide**: Added a section to `README.md` explaining how to view the SQLite database on a PC.

### Changed
- **Frontend Refactoring**: Updated all React components (`App`, `PTIList`, `PTIForm`, `Trash`, `EmailSettings`) to use asynchronous `fetch` calls instead of synchronous `localStorage` access.
- **README.md**: Completely overhauled documentation to reflect local server setup and SQLite usage.
- **.gitignore**: Added `pti.db` to ensure local databases are not tracked by Git.

### Fixed
- **Vite Build Errors**: Resolved import errors in `Trash.jsx` caused by legacy storage function references.
- **Data Persistence**: Fixed issues where data would be lost upon browser cache clearance by moving to server-side storage.

### Removed
- **Direct localStorage access**: Removed all synchronous data management logic from components.
- **Legacy Vercel Guide**: Removed outdated deployment instructions that prioritized serverless environments over the current local SQLite setup.
